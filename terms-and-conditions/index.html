    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE USE OF CIPHER VAULT

    Last Updated: June 1, 2023

    Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the Cipher Vault Android App ("the App"), as
    they set forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the App. By downloading, installing, or
    using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use
    the App.

    1. Description of the App
    Cipher Vault is an Android app designed to store user passwords and notes in an encrypted form. The App allows users
    to generate a master password, which is not stored anywhere, and the hash of the master password is stored within the
    mobile app. The master password is used to encrypt all passwords and notes, ensuring that only the user with the
    correct master password can decrypt and access the information stored within the App. The App operates offline, and an
    internet connection is not required for its use.

    2. User Responsibilities
    2.1. Security and Confidentiality
    a. You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your master password. It is your obligation to
    ensure that your master password is strong, unique, and not shared with any third parties.
    b. You acknowledge and understand that if you forget your master password, you may permanently lose access to your
    encrypted passwords and notes.

    2.2. Use of Application
    a. You agree to use the Application for lawful purposes only.
    b. You shall not use the Application to infringe upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other
    legal rights of any third party.
    c. You shall not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, modify, or create derivative works of the Application.

    3. Privacy and Data Collection
    a. The App may integrate with Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics for the purpose of collecting anonymous
    user activity data. This data may include click events, biometric events, and information related to password/note
    additions. By using the App, you consent to the collection and processing of this data as described in the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    b. The collection, storage, and use of personal information by the App are governed by the Privacy Policy, which is
    incorporated into these Terms by reference.

    4. Limited Liability
    a. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data stored within the Application. However, you
    acknowledge that no security measure is 100% foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the security of your encrypted
    passwords and notes. The App is provided on an "as-is" basis. We make no representations or warranties of any kind, 
    whether express or implied, regarding the App's availability, functionality, security, or accuracy.
    b. You understand and agree that you use the App at your own risk. We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
    incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use or inability to use the
    App, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses, even if we
    have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    c. We shall not be responsible for any security breaches, hacking incidents, or unauthorized access to your
    encrypted information stored within the App. You acknowledge that the security of your data is solely dependent on the
    strength and confidentiality of your master password.

    5. Indemnification
    You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and
    expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected
    with your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another person or entity.

    6. Intellectual Property
    The App and all its content, including but not limited to text, graphics, images, logos, and software, are the
    property of the App's developers and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a
    limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.

    7. Termination
    We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App, with or without cause and without prior notice,
    at our sole discretion. Upon termination, all licenses and rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.

    8. Changes to this Terms and Conditions
    We reserve the right to update or modify this Terms and Conditions at any time. We will notify you of any
    significant changes by posting the updated Terms and Conditions. Your continued use of the Application after such modifications
    will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified Terms and Conditions.

    9. Entire Agreement
    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the App and supersede any prior
    or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, or representations, whether oral or written, regarding the same.
